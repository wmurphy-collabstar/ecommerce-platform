# Winona's Ecommerce platform
Here is my project where I demonstrate my current skills with developing web platforms from scratch.

Here are a few different things to keep in mind:
## Initial setup
I used the following modules in my project:
- react-router-dom (npm install react-router-dom)
- material ui (npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled)
- dummy-json (npm install dummy-json)
- material ui icons (npm install @mui/icons-material
- react-responsive-carousel(npm install react-responsive-carousel)
- react-highlight-words (npm i —save react-highlight words)
- swr (npm install swr)
- react-phone-number-input (npm install react-phone-number-input —save)
- nano id (npm i nanoid)
- @mui/x-date-pickers (npm i @mui/x-date-pickers)
