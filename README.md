# Winona's Ecommerce platform
Here is my project where I demonstrate my current skills with developing web platforms from scratch.
Here is also the document that I followed to develop this platform: 
[2023 Front End Developer Mock Project_ E-commerce product catalog.docx](https://github.com/wmurphy-collabstar/ecommerce-platform/files/12235814/2023.Front.End.Developer.Mock.Project_.E-commerce.product.catalog.docx)


Here are a few different things to keep in mind:
## Initial setup
I used the following modules in my project:
- react-router-dom
- material ui
- dummy-json
- material ui icons
- react-responsive-carousel
- react-highlight-words
- swr
- react-phone-number-input
- nano id
- @mui/x-date-pickers

**Here are the steps to run in the terminal to get started after cloning this repo:**
``` bash
npm install
npm install react-router-dom
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install dummy-json
npm install @mui/icons-material
npm install react-responsive-carousel
npm i —save react-highlight words
npm install swr
npm install react-phone-number-input —save
npm i nanoid
npm i @mui/x-date-pickers
```

## Current status
Currently, the project is compiling but has many errors. Here is my current to-do list for this project:
- [ ] Debug until the website runs without any errors
- [ ] Add more formatting and basic style
- [ ] Run accessibility report, post here
- [ ] Run performance report, post here
- [ ] Improve accessibility until good score on report and post report here
- [ ] Improve performance until good score on report and post report here
- [ ] Create demo and upload to repo
- [ ] Upload source code to Netlify and post website link in README
- [ ] *Optional* Add a test suite to learn and see benefits

Realistically, this will not get all done by this week. I know I was supposed to present a finished product before joining the team, but looking at my source code will definitely show my style and how I approach projects. I also learned a lot as you will see below

## Reflection
Here are the list of resources that I used to work on this project and guide me on best practices:
[Links I used for Dmarcian E-commerce project.pdf](https://github.com/wmurphy-collabstar/ecommerce-platform/files/12235792/Links.I.used.for.Dmarcian.E-commerce.project.pdf)

As you can see, this project required quite a bit of refreshing since I had not worked on a frontend project from start to finish in a few months. I also learned that I worked from small to big picture, and that I should try doing it the other way around next time.

I think next time I can make an outline of what I want it to look like, and maybe make a wireframe. Then I will work on big picture layout and test, then work smaller and smaller until I get to the tiniest detail. That way I'm guaranteed that my website will compile with no errors at each step and the errors will be less complicated. Because of my approach, the errors and functionality ate away all the time I had for design and improving performance. I have now learned my lesson and will try to at least debug and style my platform before uploading a demo.

I will also use this project and repo as a place to test new and upcoming styles and features before implementing them in my future projects, kind of like my own mini sandbox.

I would also like to make a test suite to practice unit testing, integrated testing, etc. and understand how they can help me in the future.

I think I will also take a few courses on TDD to really enhance my skills and try to maintain this repo over time.
